# FMDV-recombination
Code for analyses of within-host FMDV quasispecies, variability and recombination, from deep sequencing of natural and experimental infections of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in buffaloes.

These analyses were implemented for the papers by Cortey et al (J. Virol. 2019) and Ferretti et al (bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/271239), both based on experiments described in Maree et al (J. Virol. 2016). Partial analyses employed in Ferretti et al (Viruses 2018) as well.
